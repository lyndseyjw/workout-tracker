## A MongoDB Workout Tracker with Dynamic UI

## Overview

This workout tracker was created to test my new knowledge of MongoDB. Previously working with MySQL & Sequelize, I created this app to challenge my skills with the more popular database of MongoDB & Mongoose. Still using routes through Express, I was able to create this application & deploy to Heroku in no time at all! MySQL & Sequelize helped me understand the format & syntax of databases while MongoDB & Mongoose made me appreciate the simplicity of their methods. I will be using their databases moving forward in my future projects.

This application gives the user an easy-to-use & aesthetically-pleasing UI that allows them to track their exercises & save to a database. With a background in preventive health, I am extremely passionate about encouraging a healthy & active lifestyle. Most people do not stick to lifestyle changes if they do not have a clearly defined goal & are unable to keep track of their progress. Since we live with ourselves every day, we are unable to see the small changes we are making on a daily basis. However, if we are able to compare ourselves to last week, we will find motivation & inspiration to commit to our change. 

I hope this application gives people the tools necessary to gift themselves with a more positive daily habit & will help them achieve their health goals. 

## Installation & Usage 

To visit the deployed application, you may do so HERE : https://dry-wildwood-23805.herokuapp.com/?id=616381e327b46d001698ab01
Users can add multiple exercises within one workout throughout the day, simply click 'add exercise' .. once the user has completed their exercise, they make click 'end workout' & all of the exercises added will be included for that particular 'workout'. This data is then rendered to the graph in the dashboard so user can track progress. User has the option to add a cardio OR resistence exercise each time they make a contribution.
